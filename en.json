    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Within the function, we first declare the `name` variable with the `var` keyword. This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of `undefined`, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`. Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the 'temporal dead zone'. When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`."

    "explanation": "Because of the event queue in JavaScript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called _after_ the loop has been executed. Since the variable `i` in the first loop was declared using the `var` keyword, this value was global. During the loop, we incremented the value of `i` by `1` each time, using the unary operator `++`. By the time the `setTimeout` callback function was invoked, `i` was equal to `3` in the first example. In the second loop, the variable `i` was declared using the `let` keyword: variables declared with the `let` (and `const`) keyword are block-scoped (a block is anything between `{ }`). During each iteration, `i` will have a new value, and each value is scoped inside the loop."

    "explanation": "Note that the value of `diameter` is a regular function, whereas the value of `perimeter` is an arrow function. With arrow functions, the `this` keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call `perimeter`, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example). There is no value `radius` on that object, which returns `undefined`."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol). Even though we might not _type_ them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood. JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement. `mouse[bird.size]`: First it evaluates `bird.size`, which is `'small'`. `mouse['small']` returns `true` However, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. `mouse` does not have a key called `bird`, which means that `mouse.bird` is `undefined`. Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we're actually asking `undefined.size`. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to `Cannot read property 'size' of undefined`."

When we mistyped `greeting` as `greetign`, the JS interpreter actually saw this as `global.greetign = {}` (or `window.greetign = {}` in a browser). In order to avoid this, we can use `'use strict'`.

So in this case,```js Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {   return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`; }; ``` would have made `member.getFullName()` work. Why is this beneficial? Say that we added this method to the constructor itself. Maybe not every `Person` instance needed this method. This would waste a lot of memory space, since they would still have that property, which takes of memory space for each instance. Instead, if we only add it to the prototype, we just have it at one spot in memory, yet they all have access to it!"

During the addition of a numeric type (`1`) and a string type (`'2'`), the number is treated as a string.

Instead, it pushes the callback function to something called the _queue_. <img src='https://i.imgur.com/NSnDZmU.png' width='200'> This is where an event loop starts to work.

This is because when you try to access a property or method on a primitive like a string, JavaScript will implicitly wrap the object using one of the wrapper classes, i.e. `String`, and then immediately discard the wrapper after the expression evaluates.

We invoke the generator function using the `next()` method. The first time we invoke the generator function, `i` is equal to `10`. It encounters the first `yield` keyword: it yields the value of `i`. The generator is now 'paused', and `10` gets logged. Then, we invoke the function again with the `next()` method. It starts to continue where it stopped previously, still with `i` equal to `10`. Now, it encounters the next `yield` keyword, and yields `i * 2`. `i` is equal to `10`, so it returns `10 * 2`, which is `20`. This results in `10, 20`."

    "explanation": "When mapping over the array, the value of `num` is equal to the element it’s currently looping over. In this case, the elements are numbers, so the condition of the if statement `typeof num === 'number'` returns `true`. The map function creates a new array and inserts the values returned from the function. However, we don’t return a value. When we don’t return a value from the function, the function returns `undefined`. For every element in the array, the function block gets called, so for each element we return `undefined`."

When we pass arguments by value, a _copy_ of that value is created (see question 46). The variable `birthYear` has a reference to the value `'1997'`. The argument `year` also has a reference to the value `'1997'`, but it's not the same value as `birthYear` has a reference to. When we update the value of `year` by setting `year` equal to `'1998'`, we are only updating the value of `year`. `birthYear` is still equal to `'1997'`. The value of `person` is an object. The argument `member` has a (copied) reference to the _same_ object.

Variables declared with the `let` keyword are _block scoped_, they are only defined within the block they're declared in; the immediately-invoked function (IIFE) in this case. When we use the `typeof` operator, the operand `x` is not defined: we are trying to access `x` outside of the block it's declared in. This means that `x` is not defined. Values who haven't been assigned a value or declared are of type `'undefined'`. `console.log(typeof x)` returns `'undefined'`. \n However, we created a global variable `y` when setting `y` equal to `10`.

Every time we call the function, a _new_ object is created. We invoke the `multiply` function the first two times without passing a value: `x` has the default value of `{ number: 10 }`. We then log the multiplied value of that number, which is `20`. The third time we invoke multiply, we do pass an argument: the object called `value`. The `*=` operator is actually shorthand for `x.number = x.number * 2`: we modify the value of `x.number`, and log the multiplied value `20`.

In this example, we are not returning any values, we are simply logging the values of the accumulator and the current value. The value of the accumulator is equal to the previously returned value of the callback function.

There is a `yield` keyword on the first line within the function: the execution stops with the first yield! _This means that the variable `answer` is not defined yet!_ When we call `game.next('Yes').value`, the previous `yield` is replaced with the value of the parameters passed to the `next()` function, `'Yes'` in this case.

When we create the variable `shape` and set it equal to the frozen object `box`, `shape` also refers to a frozen object. You can check whether an object is frozen by using `Object.isFrozen`. In this case, `Object.isFrozen(shape)` returns true, since the variable `shape` has a reference to a frozen object.

    "explanation": "The `add` function is a _memoized_ function. With memoization, we can cache the results of a function in order to speed up its execution. In this case, we create a `cache` object that stores the previously returned values. If we call the `addFunction` function again with the same argument, it first checks whether it has already gotten that value in its cache. If that's the case, the caches value will be returned, which saves on execution time. Else, if it's not cached, it will calculate the value and store it afterwards. We call the `addFunction` function three times with the same value: on the first invocation, the value of the function when `num` is equal to `10` isn't cached yet. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `false`, and the else block gets executed: `Calculated! 20` gets logged, and the value of the result gets added to the cache object. `cache` now looks like `{ 10: 20 }`. The second time, the `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged. The third time, we pass `5 * 2` to the function which gets evaluated to `10`. The `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged."

The default export is a function which returns the string `'Hello World'`, and the named export is a variable called `name` which has the value of the string `'Lydia'`. The `data` object has a `default` property for the default export, other properties have the names of the named exports and their corresponding values."

However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically added a semicolon after `return`. You could see this as: \n return; \n a + b \n \n This means that `a + b` is never reached, since a function stops running after the `return` keyword. If no value gets returned, like here, the function returns `undefined`. Note that there is no automatic insertion after `if/else` statements!"

Although we can get a promise's value with both `.then` and `await`, they work a bit differently. In the `firstFunction`, we (sort of) put the myPromise function aside while it was running, but continued running the other code, which is `console.log('second')` in this case. Then, the function resolved with the string `I have resolved`, which then got logged after it saw that the callstack was empty. With the await keyword in `secondFunction`, we literally pause the execution of an async function until the value has been resolved before moving to the next line.

However, the second one is a string `'Lydia'`. `'Lydia'` is a string and `2` is a number: `2` gets coerced into a string. `'Lydia'` and `'2'` get concatenated, which results in the string `'Lydia2'`. `{ name: 'Lydia' }` is an object.

With dot notation, JavaScript tries to find the property on the object with that exact name. In this example, JavaScript tries to find a property called `colors` on the `colorConfig` object. There is no property called `colors`, so this returns `undefined`. Then, we try to access the value of the first element by using `[1]`. We cannot do this on a value that's `undefined`, so it throws a `TypeError`: `Cannot read property '1' of undefined`. JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

    "explanation": "We set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the string with the pizza emoji, `'🍕'`. A string is a primitive data type. In JavaScript, primitive data types act by reference. In JavaScript, primitive data types (everything that's not an object) interact by _value_. In this case, we set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the value of the first element in the `food` array, the string with the pizza emoji in this case (`'🍕'`). A string is a primitive data type, and interact by value (see my [blogpost](https://www.theavocoder.com/complete-javascript/2018/12/21/by-value-vs-by-reference) if you're interested in learning more).Then, we change the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object. The `food` array hasn't changed, since the value of `favoriteFood` was merely a _copy_ of the value of the first element in the array, and doesn't have a reference to the same spot in memory as the element on `food[0]`. When we log food, it's still the original array, `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`."

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Each function has its own _execution context_ (or _scope_). The `getName` function first looks within its own context (scope) to see if it contains the variable `name` we're trying to access. In this case, the `getName` function contains its own `name` variable: we declare the variable `name` with the `let` keyword, and with the value of `'Sarah'`. Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the 'temporal dead zone'. When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`. If we wouldn't have declared the `name` variable within the `getName` function, the javascript engine would've looked down the _scope chain_. The outer scope has a variable called `name` with the value of `Lydia`. In that case, it would've logged `Lydia`. \n\n let name = 'Lydia' \n\nfunction getName() { \n  console.log(name) \n } \n\n getName() // Lydia \n"

With the `yield*` keyword, we can yield values from another generator function, or iterable object (for example an array). In `generatorOne`, we yield the entire array `['a', 'b', 'c']` using the `yield` keyword. The value of `value` property on the object returned by the `next` method on `one` (`one.next().value`) is equal to the entire array `['a', 'b', 'c']`. \n console.log(one.next().value) // ['a', 'b', 'c'] \n console.log(one.next().value) // undefined \n \n In `generatorTwo`, we use the `yield*` keyword.

This object has copies of all the key/values in the `person` object. First, we invoke the `changeAge` function and pass the `person` object as its argument. This function increases the value of the `age` property by 1. `person` is now `{ name: 'Lydia', age: 22 }`. Then, we invoke the `changeAgeAndName` function, however we don't pass a parameter. Instead, the value of `x` is equal to a _new_ object: `{ ...person }`.

Since objects interact by reference, we're just creating a new reference to the same spot in memory that `counterOne` points to. Since it has the same spot in memory, any changes made to the object that `counterTwo` has a reference to, also apply to `counterOne`. Currently, `counterTwo.count` is `2`.

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "First, we invoke `funcOne`. On the first line of `funcOne`, we call the `myPromise` promise, which is an _asynchronous_ operation. While the engine is busy completing the promise, it keeps on running the function `funcOne`. The next line is the _asynchronous_ `setTimeout` function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API. (see my article on the event loop here.) Both the promise and the timeout are asynchronous operations, the function keeps on running while it's busy completing the promise and handling the `setTimeout` callback. This means that `Last line!` gets logged first, since this is not an asynchonous operation. This is the last line of `funcOne`, the promise resolved, and `Promise!` gets logged. However, since we're invoking `funcTwo()`, the call stack isn't empty, and the callback of the `setTimeout` function cannot get added to the callstack yet. In `funcTwo` we're, first _awaiting_ the myPromise promise. With the `await` keyword, we pause the execution of the function until the promise has resolved (or rejected). Then, we log the awaited value of `res` (since the promise itself returns a promise). This logs `Promise!`. The next line is the _asynchronous_ `setTimeout` function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API. We get to the last line of `funcTwo`, which logs `Last line!` to the console. Now, since `funcTwo` popped off the call stack, the call stack is empty. The callbacks waiting in the queue (`() => console.log('Timeout!')` from `funcOne`, and `() => console.log('Timeout!')` from `funcTwo`) get added to the call stack one by one. The first callback logs `Timeout!`, and gets popped off the stack. Then, the second callback logs `Timeout!`, and gets popped off the stack. This logs `Last line! Promise! Promise! Last line! Timeout! Timeout!`"

This generator function has to yield the `Object.values` of the `person` object if we want it to return the array `['Lydia Hallie', 21]`: `yield* Object.values(this)`."
